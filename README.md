Maintenance Mode Plugin for WordPress
The Maintenance Mode plugin is a simple WordPress plugin that enables a maintenance mode for your website.
When maintenance mode is enabled, visitors to your website will see a maintenance message instead of the regular content.

Features
Enable and disable maintenance mode using a simple checkbox in the WordPress admin panel.
Set the Retry-After header to inform search engines and browsers when to check back.

Installation
Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
Go to the 'Maintenance Mode' menu under 'Settings' in the WordPress admin panel to enable maintenance mode and customize the maintenance message.

Usage
To enable maintenance mode, simply check the 'Enable Maintenance Mode' checkbox in the Maintenance Mode settings page. 
This will display the maintenance message to all visitors except for logged-in users with the 'edit_themes' capability or 'activate_plugins' capability.

Support
If you have any issues or questions about the Maintenance Mode plugin, please submit a support request.
